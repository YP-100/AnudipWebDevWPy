The Ant and the Grasshopper
Once upon a time, there was a grasshopper who spent his time enjoying the sunny days, singing and playing
around. Meanwhile, there was an ant who worked really hard, collecting and saving food for the upcoming 
winter. When winter arrived, the grasshopper hadn't prepared at all and found himself hungry and cold. 
He asked the ant for help, but the ant reminded him that he had the chance to prepare earlier and chose 
not to. So, he had to deal with the consequences of his actions.
